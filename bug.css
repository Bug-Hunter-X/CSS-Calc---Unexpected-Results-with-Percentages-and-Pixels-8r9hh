The CSS property `calc()` might lead to unexpected results if you try to combine percentages and pixels directly, especially when dealing with nested elements.  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not behave as expected if the parent element's width isn't fixed.  This is because the percentage is calculated relative to the parent's width, but the pixels are an absolute value.  If the parent width changes, the calculation of the width will change, but the 10px will stay the same, causing unpredictable outcomes.
